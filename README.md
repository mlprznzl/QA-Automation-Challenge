# QA-Automation-Challenge
My Automation Challenge for Fullstack Labs

Post-video notes:
- Should have used "private" fields where needed for the POM classes (Form.java and Appointments.java)
- Short timers (using Thread.sleep()) can be included to make tests run slower so individual test steps/actions can be better appreciated.
- Other features from TestNG such as Parallel testing using multiple threads could have been included.
- Of course, comments are missing due to the time constraint but I tried to use descriptive variable and function names to make up for it. :)
