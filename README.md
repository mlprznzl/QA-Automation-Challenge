# QA-Automation-Challenge
My Automation Challenge for Fullstack Labs

Post-video notes:
- Should have used "private" fields for the POM classes (Form.java and Appointments.java)
- Short timers (using Thread.sleep()) can be included to make tests run slower so individual test steps/actions can be better appreciated.
- Other features from TestNG such as Parallel testing using multiple threads could have been included.
